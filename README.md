# Criminal Face Detection with DeepFace & OpenCV

This Python project uses **DeepFace** and **OpenCV** to detect and recognize faces from a real-time webcam feed. It compares detected faces with a database of known criminal images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- DeepFace (`pip install deepface`)

## Setup
1. Create a folder `D:\criminals` and add images of known individuals (JPEG/PNG).
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python criminal_face_detection.py
